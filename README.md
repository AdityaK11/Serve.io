# Serve.io
Serve.io is a mobile app that connects NGOs that are helping out people with Volunteers who want to help. Both of these groups of people can come together through a single app that runs on any mobile device. The NGOs can put up tasks where they need help, add their contact details. The Volunteers can view these tasks, donate food/money and report any incidence or people that need help. The tasks displayed to the volunteers will be sorted by proximity so that they can help people closest to them conveniently. There is also a Chat Feature where both NGOs and Volunteers can interact with each other to come together to a solution. Finally, the NGOs can successfully keep a track of all of people's needs and act accordingly.
